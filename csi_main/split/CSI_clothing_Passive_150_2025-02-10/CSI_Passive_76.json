I tend to favor brands that focus on durability and consistent sizing, which makes shopping easier. Additionally, I enjoy versatile items that can be used in various settings, whether casual or more active. On the other hand, I dislike products that are poorly made or lack durability, especially if they do not meet my expectations for quality relative to their price. I also find it frustrating when items do not fit as expected or when they lose their appeal after washing. Overall, I value high-quality materials and construction, comfort, and practicality in my purchases.",
