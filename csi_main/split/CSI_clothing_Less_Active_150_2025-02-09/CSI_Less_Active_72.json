Durability and the ability to maintain their shape and color over time are also important to me. Additionally, I appreciate products that are designed with specific needs in mind, such as those tailored for women's foot shapes or those that offer moisture-wicking properties. On the other hand, I tend to dislike products that do not meet their advertised quality, such as those that lose their structure or color after a short period. I also find poor sizing or inaccurate product descriptions frustrating, especially when they do not align with my expectations for comfort and fit.",
