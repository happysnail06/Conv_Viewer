I appreciate unique designs, such as tie-dye patterns, and I tend to favor items that are versatile enough for both casual and active wear. Additionally, I prefer products that are easy to care for, like machine washable fabrics. On the other hand, I dislike items that run too large or small, as well as those that lack stretch or comfort, leading to a confining fit. I also find poor quality or ill-fitting items unappealing, as they do not meet my expectations for comfort and usability.",
