I value high-quality materials that provide a cozy feel without being overly bulky. Consistent sizing and the availability of extended sizes are important to me, as they help eliminate the guesswork in shopping. I also appreciate features that enhance functionality, such as moisture-wicking fabrics and supportive designs in activewear. On the other hand, I tend to dislike items that lack support, have poor quality control, or are overpriced for the value they provide. I find thin or flimsy materials unappealing, especially in items that are supposed to offer support or warmth. Overall, I seek a balance of comfort, quality, and practicality in my purchases.",
