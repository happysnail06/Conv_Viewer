Additionally, I enjoy products that are stylish yet functional, allowing me to wear them in different settings without sacrificing comfort. On the other hand, I dislike products that lack support, are difficult to use, or do not fit well, as these factors detract from my overall experience. I also prefer items that are straightforward to care for and maintain their quality over time.",
