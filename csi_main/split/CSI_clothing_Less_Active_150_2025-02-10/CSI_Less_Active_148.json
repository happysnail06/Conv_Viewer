I value products that are soft against the skin, have a good fit, and provide support, especially in items like leggings and shoes. I appreciate unique designs, such as tie-dye patterns, and I tend to favor items that are versatile enough for both casual and active wear. Additionally, I prefer products that are easy to care for, like machine washable fabrics. On the other hand, I dislike items that run too large or small, as well as those that lack stretch or comfort, leading to a confining fit. I also find poor quality or ill-fitting items unappealing, as they do not meet my expectations for comfort and usability.",

Trimfit was established in 1921 by Arnold, Harry and Robert Kramer. The brothers worked in a family-owned store in Manhattan, and saw an opportunity to wholesale hosiery to merchants in New York. The 1930s also marked an important event in Trimfit's history, as the company was invited to source and sell Shirley Temple socks. This product catapulted the company to a new level of sales and profitability. At this time, the Kramer brothers studied apparel manufacturing and assumed control of a textile factory in Philadelphia, which allowed them to produce and manufacture their own hosiery. 1949, Trimfit opened a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in North Carolina. Soon after, the brothers purchased a manufacturing facility in Canada and began manufacturing and selling its products to Canadian customers.
