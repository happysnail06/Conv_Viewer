I value products that maintain their size and shape after washing, as I have experienced issues with shrinkage in the past. I appreciate classic styles that can be worn casually and are versatile enough to pair with various outfits. Additionally, I tend to favor items that offer good value for money, even if they are not the highest quality. On the other hand, I dislike products that have poor sizing, thin materials, or that do not provide the comfort they promise. I am particularly sensitive to fit issues, especially with undergarments, and I find it frustrating when items do not meet my expectations in terms of comfort and durability.",
