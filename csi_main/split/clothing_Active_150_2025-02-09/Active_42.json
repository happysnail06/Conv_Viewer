I also tend to favor items that are versatile and can be worn for various occasions. On the other hand, I dislike products that lack proper support, cause discomfort, or have sizing inconsistencies. I am particularly sensitive to poor quality materials that lead to issues like peeling or discomfort after extended wear. Additionally, I find high-maintenance items, especially those that require special care to maintain their appearance, to be less appealing.",
