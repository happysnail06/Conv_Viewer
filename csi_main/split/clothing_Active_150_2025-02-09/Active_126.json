However, I found it lacking in functionality, as it provided minimal support and coverage, making it unsuitable for everyday wear. The comfort of the material was a positive aspect, but ultimately, it did not meet my practical needs as an undergarment.",

The description highlighted its seamless finish and flexible fit, which appealed to my need for a casual and comfortable bra for lounging and sleeping. The adjustable straps were a significant factor in my decision, as they allowed for customization in support, making it a practical choice for my lifestyle.",

I appreciated the suggestion to size down, which indicated that the product could still meet my needs for support while being comfortable enough for all-day wear."

Additionally, I enjoy products that offer a good fit without being overly restrictive, especially in activewear. On the other hand, I dislike items that are poorly constructed, such as those that pill or fray easily, and I am not fond of overly cropped or ill-fitting designs that do not suit my body type. I also prefer clothing that is easy to care for and maintain its quality over time.",
