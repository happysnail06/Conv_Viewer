I value items that are true to size and made from high-quality materials that retain their shape and color after multiple washes. I appreciate styles that can be dressed up or down, allowing for flexibility in different settings, whether casual or slightly formal. Additionally, I enjoy vibrant colors and unique designs that stand out without being overly flashy. On the other hand, I tend to dislike items that are poorly constructed, have inconsistent sizing, or require excessive maintenance, such as hand washing. I also find overly large or ill-fitting garments unappealing, as they can detract from the overall look and comfort.",
