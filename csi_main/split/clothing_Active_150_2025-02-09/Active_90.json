The vibrant colors and lightweight feel were important, as well as the moisture-wicking properties.

Additionally, I enjoy products that are aesthetically pleasing and come in a variety of options. On the other hand, I tend to dislike items that do not meet my expectations in terms of fit or support, particularly when they are marketed for specific body types. I also find it frustrating when products are not true to size or when they lack the promised features, such as moisture-wicking capabilities or adequate cushioning.",
