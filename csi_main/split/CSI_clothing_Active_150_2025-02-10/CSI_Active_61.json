Comfort features like plush cushioning, breathable fabrics, and thoughtful design elements, such as structured collars and flexible waistbands, are important to me. I also appreciate products that maintain their shape and quality after washing. On the other hand, I tend to dislike items that have inconsistent sizing, poor fit, or that feel flimsy or cheap. I prefer products that are true to size and offer a tailored look without being overly tight. Overall, I look for a balance of style, comfort, and quality in my purchases.",
