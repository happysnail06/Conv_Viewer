My previous positive experiences with the brand also influenced my decision.",

I appreciate brands that provide a balance of quality and affordability, and I tend to favor items that are versatile enough to be worn in various settings, from casual outings to more dressed-up occasions. Additionally, I have a strong preference for products that are easy to wear, such as slip-ons, and I enjoy options that are vegan-friendly. On the other hand, I dislike products that do not fit well, particularly those that are too wide for my feet, and I am not fond of items that are overpriced or do not deliver on comfort and quality.",
