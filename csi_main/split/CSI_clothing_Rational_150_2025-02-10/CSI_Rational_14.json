Additionally, I tend to favor items that are well-priced and provide good value for money, even if they are not the absolute highest quality. On the other hand, I dislike overly baggy fits, poor quality materials that snag or rip easily, and items that do not fit true to size, as these can lead to discomfort and dissatisfaction.",
