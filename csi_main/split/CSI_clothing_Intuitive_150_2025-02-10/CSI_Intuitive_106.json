Trimfit was established in 1921 by Arnold, Harry and Robert Kramer. The brothers worked in a family-owned store in Manhattan, and saw an opportunity to wholesale hosiery to merchants in New York. The 1930s also marked an important event in Trimfit's history, as the company was invited to source and sell Shirley Temple socks. This product catapulted the company to a new level of sales and profitability. At this time, the Kramer brothers studied apparel manufacturing and assumed control of a textile factory in Philadelphia, which allowed them to produce and manufacture their own hosiery. 1949, Trimfit opened a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in North Carolina. Soon after, the brothers purchased a manufacturing facility in Canada and began manufacturing and selling its products to Canadian customers. Today, our assortment includes underwear, t-shirts, training pants, slippers, footwear, thermals, sleepwear and much more! Trimfit’s broad range of sizes for girls and boys aged 0 to 18, provides comfort, quality, and ease at a value unmatched by other brands. Trimfit designs their clothing and apparel by adjusting to the needs of children. Having comfortable and dependable clothing not only makes your children happier but offers parents relief in knowing their children are well prepared for any scenario.\"] \nItem No.3 : Item Title: <Hanes Boxer Briefs, Cool Dri Moisture-Wicking Underwear, Cotton No-Ride-up for Men, Multi-Packs Available> / Item ID: B0BH113WW9 / Price: $25.0 Category Path: ['Clothing Shoes & Jewelry', 'Men', 'Clothing', 'Underwear', 'Boxer Briefs'] / Description: [\"This men's boxer briefs multipack is made from 100% cotton that's soft and breathable for everyday comfort (heathered styles are a cotton-rich blend).
