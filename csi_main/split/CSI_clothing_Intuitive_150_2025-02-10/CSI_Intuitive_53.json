I value items that maintain their shape and appearance after washing, as well as those that offer versatility in styling, allowing for easy pairing with different outfits. I appreciate thoughtful design details, such as smooth seams and functional features like pockets or zippers that enhance usability. Additionally, I tend to favor products that are true to size and have consistent sizing across different styles. On the other hand, I dislike items that have inconsistent sizing, poor quality, or that do not hold up well after washing. I find it frustrating when products do not fit as expected or when they lose their comfort and softness over time.",
